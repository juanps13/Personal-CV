# Telecommunications Company Business Case

## Problem statement

A telecommunications company implemented a promotion to boost its landline sales. The promotion offered a 50% discount on calls to 10 destinations of the customer's choice. The company hypothesized that by reducing the price of calls to 10 specific numbers, customers would increase their landline usage and potentially make more calls to non-discounted numbers. The promotion was rolled out in the second week of July to 130 customers, who were informed about the discount for their selected 10 numbers.
